Question

How does a CareLink Monitor receive firmware updates from the network?

 

Response

CareLink monitors automatically check for and apply updates from the Firmware Distribution Network (FDN). The FDN check occurs during the monitor maintenance session. After the initial setup transmission and maintenance session, 2490C monitors will continue to check for updates every 15 days after the last successful maintenance session. 2490G/H monitors check and download available updates following a patient manual transmission.

Notes:

2490G/H monitors should not be disconnected immediately following a transmission as the monitor needs time to receive an update via the network.
2490C monitors perform an evening maintenance session just after midnight following a successful scheduled (wireless) transmission, and a programmable maintenance session around midnight on the 3rd business day following the scheduled transmission receipt date.  
2490C monitors will NEVER perform a maintenance session following a manual transmission.
